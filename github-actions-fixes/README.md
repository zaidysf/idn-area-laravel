# GitHub Actions Fixes for Laravel 10-12 Support

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Enhanced Dependency Resolution
- Added explicit dependency requirements with proper version ranges for all Laravel versions
- Added `--with-dependencies` flag to ensure proper resolution
- Improved Orchestra Testbench version compatibility

### 2. PHPStan Workflow Improvements
- Added matrix strategy to test against multiple PHP/Laravel combinations
- Added `develop` branch to triggers for consistency
- Improved dependency installation with Laravel framework requirement

### 3. Code Style Workflow Improvements
- Updated to use `composer install` instead of `composer update` for consistency
- Added proper composer tool specification
- Updated PHP version to 8.3 for better stability

### 4. Test Workflow Enhancements
- Enhanced dependency installation process with explicit requirements
- Added proper version constraints for all dev dependencies
- Improved compatibility across all Laravel 10-12 versions

## Key Changes Made

1. **Consistent Branch Triggers**: All workflows now trigger on both `main` and `develop` branches
2. **Better Dependency Management**: Explicit dependency requirements with proper version ranges
3. **PHP Version Optimization**: Using PHP 8.3 as the default for single-version jobs
4. **Laravel Framework Integration**: Proper Laravel framework requirement in all workflows

## Files to Replace

Replace the following files in `.github/workflows/`:

1. `tests.yml` - Enhanced test matrix with better dependency resolution
2. `phpstan.yml` - Matrix strategy for multiple PHP/Laravel combinations  
3. `fix-php-code-style-issues.yml` - Improved dependency management

## Manual Steps Required

Since I cannot directly modify workflow files due to GitHub App permissions, please:

1. Copy the contents of each file in this directory
2. Replace the corresponding files in `.github/workflows/`
3. Commit and push the changes
4. Test the workflows to ensure they pass

The fixes ensure proper Laravel 10-12 support with optimized dependency resolution and consistent workflow behavior across all supported PHP versions.
